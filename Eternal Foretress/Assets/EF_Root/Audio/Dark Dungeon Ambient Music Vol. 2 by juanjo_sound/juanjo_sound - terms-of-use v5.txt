juanjo_sound

Terms of use (boring but necessary):

- I must be credited as either "Michael Barker" or "juanjo_sound", or both! Example: "Music by Michael Barker (juanjo_sound)". And if possible, provide a link to my itch.io page. If the link isn't possible, don't worry :) (https://juanjosound.itch.io/)

- I'm not currently permitting anyone to upload this music (in any form) to music streaming services, such as Spotify, Apple Music, Bandcamp etc. This includes any music that samples a part of this music.

- No matter what, content ID (or any other copyright claim) cannot be placed on my YouTube channel or any videos on the channel, "https://www.youtube.com/@juanjo_sound". Similarly, copyright claims should not be placed on anyone else's videos containing this music. Example: "John posts my music on Spotify (not allowed), then John checks a box saying "Enable Content ID" (not allowed)". Checking the Content ID box essentially means he has enabled an automated system, which claims monetisation from other places where the music appears. This is not allowed and I will unfortunately be required to issue complaints in response to anyone attempting to do this. I have full and extensive proof that I am the creator of this content, so I would automatically win any dispute of this nature. I periodically check the web for people attempting this via scanning tools.

- This is primarily aimed at things like video games, movies, adverts, or anything where the music is clearly being used as background music to something more significant. Rather than the music being the primary focus.

- Lastly, if you use this music in YouTube videos, it must be used as background music to something, rather than the music being the primary main focus of the video. Meaning it can't be used in video types such as, "Creepy Horror Background Music", or anything which draws primary attention to the music.
